# Character Recognition Models

This GitHub repository contains machine learning models for character recognition in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, and German. We have implemented various models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Echo State Networks (ESN), and a combination of CNN and ESN for classification purposes.

## Models Included

1. CNN Model: This model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks to perform character recognition. It is implemented as a class, allowing users to easily integrate it into their own projects.

2. ResNet50 Model: Using the ResNet50 architecture, this class-based model excels in character recognition, utilizing deep skip connections for feature extraction and providing versatility with pre-trained weights on ImageNet.

3. VGG16 Model: Using VGG16 architecture known for its deep and uniform structure to recognize MNIST with pre-trained weights on ImageNet.

4. ESN Model: The Echo State Network model is another approach for character recognition. Similar to the CNN model, it is implemented as a class for convenient usage.

5. EUSN Model: The Euler State Network (ESN) model is a powerful approach for character recognition, implemented as a class for seamless integration and ease of use. Harness the potential of ESNs to unlock accurate and efficient character classification.

6. CNN-ESN Combo Model: We have also developed a combined model that leverages the strengths of both CNN and ESN. This hybrid model aims to achieve improved accuracy and performance in character classification tasks.

7. CNN-EUSN Model: The CNN-Euler State Network (ESN) model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and ESNs for robust and accurate character recognition. This hybrid model, implemented as a class, offers a seamless integration of both CNN and ESN techniques, enabling you to leverage the power of deep learning and dynamic temporal modeling. Experience the best of both worlds with the CNN-ESN model for advanced character classification tasks.


## Implementations

1. Basic Implementations: We provide basic implementations of the CNN and ESN models, which do not rely on any external libraries. These implementations are suitable for users who prefer a lightweight solution or want to understand the core concepts of the models.

2. Advanced Implementations: In addition to the basic implementations, we offer advanced implementations that utilize external libraries for enhanced functionality and performance. These implementations may require additional dependencies, but they provide more advanced features and optimizations.

## Usage

To use any of the models included in this repository, simply import the corresponding class into your project. You can then instantiate the class and utilize its methods for character recognition tasks. We recommend referring to the documentation and code comments for detailed instructions on how to use each model effectively.
